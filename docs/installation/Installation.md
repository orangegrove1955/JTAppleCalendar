# Installation

This library can be installed in 3 ways; Cocoapods, Carthage, or manually.

## Via Cocoapods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```
gem install cocoapods
```

> [!NOTE]
> CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build JTApplecalendar.

To integrate JTAppleCalendar into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'JTAppleCalendar', '~>; 7.1'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```
pod install
```

Once installation is complete, JTAppleCalendar should be installed

## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re new to CocoaPods, search how to integrate Cocoapods into your project. CocoaPods is one of the top dependency managers for integrating 3rd party frameworks into your project. But in a nut-shell, here is how to complete installation with a sample project called `test`

1. Install Cocoapods
2. Create a new xcode project. Save the name as: `test`
3. Go to your console in the directory location where your project is located
4. Type and run the command: `pod init`

This will create a `Podfile` in that same location

Edit `Podfile` so that it looks like the following:

```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project

# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'test' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'JTAppleCalendar'
end
```

Save, and head back to terminal and run: `pod install`

If all went well, installation should be complete. Close the XCodeproject, and instead reopen it using the workspace file which was generated when installation was completed

## Via Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following commands:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```

To integrate JTAppleCalendar into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`

```
github "patchthecode/JTAppleCalendar" ~> 7.1
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `JTApplecalendar.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Manually install

Simply drag the source files into your project. Make sure you remove the unnecessary import statements where needed.
