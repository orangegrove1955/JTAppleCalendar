## Why use this library?

TODO - add gif image

- **Total customization of all views** ‚Äì This lib does not design anything. It only provides a layout (7 columns and 1-6 rows). Therefore any visual design of both cells and calendar is possible.
- **Horizontal or vertical mode** ‚Äì Ability to switch from a vertical scrolling to horizontal scrolling calendar.
- **Range selection** ‚Äì Select dates in a range.
- **Week/Month mode** ‚Äì 7 columns (Sunday to Saturday). But you decide how many rows to display. Number of rows are limited to the range 1 to 6.
- **Custom first day of week** ‚Äì First day of week does not have to be Sunday. You can pick any day.
- Headers ‚Äì Ability to add headers of varying sizes for each month.

These are a fraction of many more features. Here are [calendar styles](https://github.com/patchthecode/JTAppleCalendar/issues/2) created by developers using this lib.

## Repetitive questions/ delayed answers

Familiarity with the following non-calendar pointers, helps avoid repetitive questions and delayed answers.

- How to use UITableView or UICollectionView and understand how delegate functions work. Knowledge that cells are reused in these controls.
- Questions about this library asked on Github, will get a faster response than contacting me by email.
- Knowledge about the iOS Calendar() class and how time zones work in iOS to avoid questions such as this one (2nd most repeated question).

This does not mean I won‚Äôt answer such questions, but i‚Äôll be in better spirits if library specific ones are asked, rather than the famous most-repeated question:

```
hey i‚Äôm new to Swift, how do i xyz?‚Äù üôÇ
